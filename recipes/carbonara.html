        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong>: This traditional Italian recipe starts with olive oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Guanciale</strong>: Buy guanciale (or cured pork cheek) at your local butcher. If you canâ€™t find it, you can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta.</li>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti noodles. If you like, you can substitute bucatini for the spaghetti. </li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Three large eggs add richness and flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Opt for hand-shredded Pecorino Romano cheese. You can substitute Parmesan, if preferred.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This flavorful spaghetti alla carbonara is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pork in olive oil until browned and crispy, then drain on paper towels.</li>

            <li>Whisk the eggs, 1/2 of the cheese, and some pepper in a bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy.</li>
