        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pho is a soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, thinly-sliced meat (in this recipe, it's beef), and fresh garnishes. It is believed to have been created in northern Vietnam in the early 20th century.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beef Soup Bones</strong>: Use the shank and knee to make the homemade bone broth.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice Noodles</strong>: You should be able to find dry rice noodles at most grocery stores, either in the international aisle or another pantry aisle.</li>
            <li><strong>Beef</strong>: This recipe calls for beef top sirloin. Make sure it's thinly sliced so the hot broth can cook it.</li>
            <li><strong>Fish Sauce</strong>: Fish sauce will give the pho a hint of salty, fishy flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong>: Roast the onions for an extra depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings</strong>: This recipe calls for ginger, star anise, and salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnishes</strong>: Garnish your pho with cilantro, green onion, Thai basil, lime, hoisin sauce, sriracha, or anything else you like.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Roast the beef bones and onions until the bones are browned and the onions are soft.</li>
            <li>Combine roasted beef bones, roasted onions, ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and water in a large stockpot. Allow to simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Then, strain the broth into a new saucepan.</li>
            <li>Allow dry rice noodles to soak for 1 hour. While they're soaking, bring broth to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Cook the rice noodles in boiling water. Drain and add noodles to a bowl topped with sirloin, cilantro, green onion, and broth. Garnish with your desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>
